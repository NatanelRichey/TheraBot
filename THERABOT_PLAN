    """Extract training examples from official DBT guidebook"""
    
    examples = []
    
    # Extract skill teaching sections
    skill_sections = extract_skill_sections(guidebook)
    for section in skill_sections:
        examples.append(create_teaching_example(section))
    
    # Extract validation examples
    validation_sections = extract_validation_examples(guidebook)
    for section in validation_sections:
        examples.append(create_validation_example(section))
    
    return examples
```

#### Content Categories to Extract

1. **Skill Explanations** ‚Üí Convert to instruction/input/output format
2. **Therapeutic Responses** ‚Üí Extract validation and teaching examples
3. **Crisis Protocols** ‚Üí Create crisis intervention examples
4. **Mindfulness Exercises** ‚Üí Generate mindfulness teaching examples

#### Quality Control Process

- Review each example for DBT accuracy
- Ensure proper validation language ("It makes sense that...")
- Include skill acronyms (TIP, PLEASE, DEAR MAN, etc.)
- Maintain dialectical balance (acceptance + change)

### üéØ Implementation Strategy

#### Training Data Structure

```python
final_dataset = {
    "general_therapy": 171000,  # Your existing data
    "dbt_specific": 3000,       # From guidebook + manuals
    "total": 174000
}
```

#### DBT System Prompt Template

```python
dbt_system_prompt = """
You are a DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) therapist. While you have training in various therapeutic approaches, you specialize in DBT and should primarily use DBT techniques.

DBT Core Principles:
1. VALIDATION: Always validate emotions first ("It makes sense that...")
2. DIALECTICS: Balance acceptance and change
3. SKILLS: Teach practical coping strategies
4. MINDFULNESS: Incorporate present-moment awareness

When responding:
- Start with validation and empathy
- Use DBT skills (TIP, PLEASE, DEAR MAN, etc.)
- Maintain dialectical thinking
- Focus on behavioral change
- Incorporate mindfulness when appropriate

Avoid: CBT restructuring, psychoanalytic interpretation, other modalities
Prioritize: DBT skills, validation, dialectical thinking
"""
```

### üìà Expected Outcomes

- Strong DBT language patterns in responses
- Consistent validation approach
- Proper skill teaching methodology
- Authentic DBT terminology and techniques

## Memory & Context Management Strategy

### üß† Critical Need for Therapist Memory

**Therapy Context Requirements:**

- **Session Continuity**: Remember client's goals, progress, and patterns across sessions
- **Personal Details**: Recall important life events, relationships, triggers, and coping strategies
- **Therapeutic History**: Track skill usage, what's worked/not worked, and treatment plan
- **Crisis Patterns**: Remember previous crisis situations and effective interventions
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement in specific areas over time

### üîß Proposed Memory Solutions

#### Option A: External Memory Systems (Recommended)

**Implementation**: Store structured session summaries and client notes

**Advantages**:

- Clear separation of concerns (model vs. memory)
- Easy to audit and modify
- Privacy-friendly (can be encrypted/stored separately)
- Scalable and maintainable

**Technical Approach**:

```python
# Session memory structure
session_memory = {
    "client_id": "anonymous_123",
    "session_summary": "Client discussed anxiety triggers at work...",
    "key_points": ["Work stress", "Sleep issues", "DBT TIP skill helpful"],
    "goals": ["Better sleep", "Work anxiety management"],
    "skills_used": ["TIP", "mindfulness", "validation"],
    "next_focus": "Emotion regulation skills"
}
```

#### Option B: Vector-Based Retrieval (RAG) - Future Enhancement

**Implementation**: Store conversation embeddings for semantic retrieval

**Advantages**:

- Automatic relevance detection
- Handles complex queries about past topics
- Can find related patterns across sessions

**Status**: **Research during Phase 2** - Consider for advanced features after MVP

**Technical Approach**:

```python
# RAG implementation for therapy context
def retrieve_relevant_context(user_input, client_history):
    # Generate embeddings for current input
    query_embedding = embed(user_input)
    
    # Find similar past conversations
    relevant_contexts = vector_search(query_embedding, client_history)
    
    return format_context_for_model(relevant_contexts)
```

#### Option C: Model-Level Long-Term Memory (Experimental)

**Status**: Research stage, not production-ready

**Consideration**: Monitor HuggingFace research for future implementation

### üìÖ Implementation Timeline

**During Training/Fine-tuning Stage:**

- **NOT REQUIRED**: Memory systems are application-level features
- **Focus on**: Model's ability to reference context within single conversations
- **Training Data**: Ensure conversations include proper context references

**During Application Development Stage:**

- **Implement**: External memory system or RAG
- **Integrate**: Memory retrieval into conversation flow
- **Add**: Privacy controls and data management

            "bot": bot_response,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })
    
    def get_session_context(self):
        # Return last 10 exchanges for context
        return self.current_session[-10:]
```

        self.vector_store.add_embeddings(session_data)
        self.structured_notes.add_summary(session_data)
    
    def retrieve_context(self, current_input):
        # Combine vector search with structured queries
        relevant_history = self.vector_store.search(current_input)

## Phase 6: Deployment (Day 6-7)

### üöÄ Cursor Prompt: Deployment Strategy

**Prompt for Cursor:**

```
Create a comprehensive deployment strategy for the DBT therapy chatbot.
Consider both development and production environments with proper CI/CD.

Requirements:
1. Set up HuggingFace Spaces deployment for backend
2. Configure Vercel deployment for frontend
3. Implement environment variable management
4. Add monitoring and logging configuration
5. Create deployment documentation and scripts

Before implementing, ask me:
- Should we use HuggingFace Inference API or deploy the model directly?
- What monitoring and alerting do you want to implement?
- Should we set up staging and production environments?
- How do you want to handle secrets and environment variables?
- Do you need CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment?
- What backup and disaster recovery strategies should we implement?

Provide multiple deployment options and explain the trade-offs of each approach.
```

### üîß Cursor Prompt: Environment Configuration

**Prompt for Cursor:**

```
Create a comprehensive environment configuration system for the DBT chatbot.
Include development, staging, and production configurations.

Requirements:
1. Implement environment-specific configuration files
2. Add secrets management and security best practices
3. Create Docker configurations for consistent deployment
4. Add health checks and monitoring endpoints
5. Implement proper logging and error tracking

Before implementing, ask me:
- What environment variables do you need for each stage?
- How should we handle sensitive data like API keys?
- Should we implement feature flags for gradual rollouts?
- What logging levels and formats do you prefer?
- How do you want to handle database connections and migrations?

Break down configuration into logical modules and explain the security considerations.
```

Break down testing into specific test cases and explain the testing strategy for each component.
```

### üìä Cursor Prompt: Evaluation & Metrics System

**Prompt for Cursor:**

```
Create a comprehensive evaluation and metrics system for the DBT chatbot.
Include both automated metrics and human evaluation frameworks.

Requirements:
1. Implement conversation quality metrics (empathy, DBT accuracy)
2. Add safety and bias evaluation tools
3. Create user satisfaction and feedback analysis
4. Implement model performance monitoring
5. Add business metrics and usage analytics

Before implementing, ask me:
- What specific metrics should we track for therapeutic quality?
- How should we measure user satisfaction and engagement?
- What safety metrics are most important to monitor?
- Should we implement real-time monitoring and alerting?
- How do you want to handle data privacy in analytics?
